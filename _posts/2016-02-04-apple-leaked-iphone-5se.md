Apple is currently aiming to unveil the new 4-inch the iPhone 5se, the iPad Air 3, and new Apple Watch band options at an event on Tuesday, March 15th, according to sources. 

We previously reported that Apple was on track to launch the new products during the week of March 14th. As the scheduled event is still a month-and-a-half away, the date could conceivably still shift or turn into an online announcement. The media event would be Apple’s first since September, and much like the fall event, is planned to touch on three major product categories for the company.

### iPhone 5se

If the rumors are accurate, the iPhone 5se should give customers who prefer smaller form factors something to be excited about. The handset will have a four-inch screen like the iPhone 5s, but run Apple’s in-house designed 64-bit A9 chip, plus NFC for Apple Pay, enhanced cameras and Live Photos.

### iPad Air 3 Cover
