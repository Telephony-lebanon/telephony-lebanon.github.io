Well, it’s a online music streaming services available for people in US and some other countries. But what make it different from rest is, audio quality, music recommendation algorithm and huge collection of playlist.

Apparently Spotify is struggling for Patent and licensing, which is why it’s limited to US and UK. Although their team ensure that it will be available worldwide soon, it has been over 2 years now. But still no progress. So here is a simple workaround to help you listen Spotify outside US and UK.

The service is available only in select countries such as United States, United Kingdom etc. Check the complete list of [supported countries](https://www.spotify.com/int/select-your-country/).

Step 1: First of all, we will have to change our proxy server to UK. There are many online web services available, but I personally recommend Tunnel Bear for the task. Using Tunnel Bear for Windows you can surf using UK and US proxy with a maximum bandwidth cap of 500 MB, which is more than enough for the task. You will have to create a free account before you can use Tunnel Bear.

Step 2: After activating the UK proxy on Tunnel Bear, open Spotify homepage and click on the Sign up button to make an account. It’s mandatory to have a Facebook account to register to Spotify.

Step 3 (Optional): After you register with Spotify, log in to your account and select Edit profile from top-right corner. In the account settings, select United Kingdom as your current country and save the information. That’s the reason why we are on a UK proxy. If you are not on a UK proxy, Spotify will not allow you to change your country information.

Step 4: That’s all, you can go ahead and install Spotify on your computer. You can log in using your Facebook login credentials. Don’t disconnect the VPN service till you log in for the first time.

Voila, after Spotify logs you in for the first time, you can use it anytime you want even without VPN service.
